# Autocutter
The .jsx script can be used with Adobe's Extendscript framework to automatically cut a video in Premiere Pro based on timestamps in a .txt file.

Ideal for film projects involving a team of people. One person can type down timestamps for a video and send these to an editor as a text file. The editor then uses the Autocutter script with the timestamps and source video to make the intended cuts within seconds.

Ready for use but still may contain bugs - presave work beforehand.

Thanks!

## Instructions

1) Ensure Video (.mp4) and Timestamps (.txt) are saved onto your computer.
2) Check formatting of timestamps is correct as show in the example.

  0:05-0:14<br>
  1:23-2:02<br>
  12:21-12:35<br>
  5:30-5:35<br>

  Each line holds one pair of start and end times for a subclip, in minutes and seconds. 

  Make sure to use the symbols ":" and "-" as shown in the example.

  Spaces are acceptable.
  
  3) Ideally, open new Adobe PP project to avoid errors.
  4) Run script in preferred manner (Check YouTube, Google, etc. for various methods)
