# Autocutter
The .jsx script can be used with Adobe's Extendscript framework and other methods with Premiere Pro to cut media files based on timestamps in a .txt file.

Ideal for film projects involving a team of people. One person can type down timestamps for a video/audio file and send these to an editor as a text (.txt) file. The editor can then use the Autocutter script with the timestamps and source media to make the intended cuts in no time at all - saving hours of manually cutting out clips.

Ready for use but still may contain bugs - presave crucial work beforehand.

Thanks!

## Instructions

- Ensure Source Media* and Timestamps (.txt) are saved onto your computer.

  The script works with most video and audio formats compatible with Adobe PP 2020, but some formats may not work.

- Check formatting of timestamps is correct as show in the example.

    0:05-0:14<br>
    1:23-2:02<br>
    12.21-12.35<br>
    5.30-5.35<br>

  Each line holds one pair of start and end times for a subclip, in minutes and seconds. 

  "-" are for separating start and end times.
  
  ":" or "." are for separating seconds and minutes

  Breaks and Spaces are acceptable too.
  
- Ideally, run in new Adobe PP project to avoid errors.

- Run script in preferred manner (Check YouTube, Google, etc. for various methods)
