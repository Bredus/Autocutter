# Autocutter
The .jsx script can be used with Adobe's Extendscript framework to automatically cut a video in Premiere Pro based on timestamps in a .txt file.

Ideal for film projects involving a team of people. One person can type down timestamps for a video and send these to an editor as a text file. The editor then uses the Autocutter script with the timestamps and source video to make the intended cuts within seconds.

Ready for use but still may contain bugs - presave any important work.

Thanks!
